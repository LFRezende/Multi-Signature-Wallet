Scratch 1 - Remove owner function

Key features to watchout:
    1 -  Remapping of the indexes is required.
    2 -  Owner can be in the middle.

[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

Let's remove D. Doing so equates to shifting the whole rest of the array and then popping the last one.
[A, B, C, E, F, G, H, H]
[A, B, C, E, F, G, H]
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6

All of the elements before index stay the same index, all of the other decrease 1 in value.
